                    The gang caught the attention of Inspector Chester Campbell (played by Sam Neill) with their son
                    robbery, and was sent to Birmingham by then Secretary of State Winston Churchill to investigate the
                    robbery. Its targets are gangs, gangsters, communists and joint criminals. Chester vows to clean the
                    city of these illegal organizations, and then brings his own team from Belfast on the job before and
                    begins to work. [4] [5] Winston Churchill was played by Andy Nyman of the first type and Richard
                    McCabe of the second type.

                    The second series is about two years after the first series. The Shelby family sees them as
                    expanding their criminal organization in the "North and South London" area. [6] The second series
                    begins in 1921 and finds a son with the Epsom Derby in June 1922.

                    The third series is about two years later and starts in 1924. Tommy and his family enter a more
                    dangerous world and expand the organization further, but this time the expansion is international.
                    According to Internet-based film and television news company Screen Rant, "Seasonal concepts of
                    social classes and empire are perhaps returning.

                    As it can be understood, the series tells about the decay of empires that grew over time, becoming
                    complex, and collapsing by not being able to continue in this way. The season taught Tommy how to
                    expand while swimming in polluted waters and how to pay attention to other sharks, especially those
                    with a huge influence on the government. Peaky Blinders essentially tells the story of a fish that
                    moves fast outside its comfort zone and expands too far at risk. There are times, it is prepaid.
